# A JIT-less, Register-Mapped, Statically-Typed Virtual Machine for Interpreters

These are the source files and results of my BSc Hons Computer Science project.

The virtual machines are located in the `Virtual Machines` directory.

## Building and Running Virtual Machines
###Prerequisites for building the virtual machines:
The virtual machines were designed with these prerequisites. Other versions may work also.
* GNU Make 4.0
* GNU Compiler Collection v5.1.1
* GNU C Standard Library v2.21
* Ruby v2.2.3
* Liquid Templating Engine for Ruby v3.01

To compile a virtual machine, run `make` in the directory of the virtual machine.
