* Jamie's Comments:
** Content:
Background: Well written
Problem description: Needs to be more to the point, possibly
reduce to a single paragraph
Project Goals and scope need to be separated
Risks: Create a section for risks

** General:
Scientific writing discourages the use of first person pronouns

** Overall:
A really good first draft
* Summary of Document Comments
** TODO Again, first person
** He said I should shorten my problem description to one paragraph. I think that's a little crazy so I will only shorten it in terms of Brandon's analogous comment
** TODO He suggested I split "Purpose and Scope" into two sections. I think I kind of like it though. Maybe it requires some thought
