\chapter*{Abstract}
Traditional JIT-less high-level virtual machines simulate virtual registers in random access memory and perform a dispatch whenever that register is accessed. This treatise investigates an alternative approach where virtual registers are mapped to physical registers, and virtual machine instructions are dispatched to a table of pre-compiled subroutines which emulate the behaviour of the virtual machine instruction. This table is indexed not only on virtual opcodes, but also on the operands of the virtual instructions. Thus, to emulate a virtual instruction, the interpreter jumps to the appropriate code segment in the table based on the instruction word to be executed. This table grows in a polynomial fashion with increased virtual registers, and therefore the performance balance between table size and register pressure is investigated.
